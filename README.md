## ðŸ§  About Me
Iâ€™m currently pursuing my **MSc in Bioinformatics**, where Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in **computational biology, data science, and AI-driven healthcare**.  
My focus is on applying **Python, R, and machine learning** to analyse biological data and uncover patterns that support better understanding of disease mechanisms and treatment discovery.

Alongside my studies, Iâ€™m completing the **AWS Cloud Practictioner Essesntials ** to deepend my knowledge on AWS services (like S3, SageMaker, and Lambda) for data storage, processing, and machine learning workflows, while understanding cost, security, and scalability considerations.

I am open to explore a range of opportunities in **biotech, data science, data engineering

## ðŸ”¬ Current Focus Areas
- **Python & R programming** for biological data analysis  
- **Statistical Machine Learning** for omics and healthcare datasets  
- **Linux & Bash scripting** for reproducible bioinformatics workflows  
- **Data visualization** using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `ggplot2`  
- **Multi-omics integration** (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics)  
- **AI for healthcare** â€“ explainable models and real-world data interpretation. Explainable AI

## ðŸ“ˆ My skillset includes:

- ðŸ§¬ Biopython, Pandas, BLAST, NCBIWWW, SeqIO
- ðŸ“Š Statistical analysis: ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk, feature selection
- ðŸ§  Real-world project experience in transcriptomics, genomics & viral sequence tracking
- ðŸ§ª NHS lab experience with FFPE block preparation, reagent handling & UKAS-compliant workflows
- ðŸŒ± Currently levelling up through personal projects, MSc Bioinformatics preparation, and continued NHS experience â€” aiming to specialise in clinical bioinformatics and contribute to precision medicine.
