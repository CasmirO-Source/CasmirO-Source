## Hi there 👋

I’m Casmir, a Biomedical Science graduate (2:1, IBMS-accredited) currently working at NHS John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, contributing to histopathology diagnostics and tissue processing.

I’m now pivoting into **computational biology**, combining my clinical foundation with a growing skillset in **bioinformatics, Python, and data analysis** — with the goal of joining the NHS STP Bioinformatics programme or a research-intensive MSc in 2025

💻 I’m passionate about bioinformatics, multi-omics data analysis, and using Python to uncover patterns in biological datasets. My GitHub is a growing collection of self-driven projects, scripts, and pipelines — from sequence alignment tools to omics integration systems.

## 📈 My skillset includes:

🧬 Biopython, Pandas, BLAST, NCBIWWW, SeqIO
📊 Statistical analysis: ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk, feature selection
🧠 Real-world project experience in transcriptomics, genomics & viral sequence tracking
🧪 NHS lab experience with FFPE block preparation, reagent handling & UKAS-compliant workflows
🌱 Currently levelling up through personal projects, MSc Bioinformatics preparation, and continued NHS experience — aiming to specialise in clinical bioinformatics and contribute to precision medicine.

## 📚 Projects highlight:

- COVID-19 Sequence Tracker
- Gene Identification Tool
- Multi-Omics Integration Pipeline
