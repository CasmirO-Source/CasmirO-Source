## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Casmir, a Biomedical Science graduate (2:1, IBMS-accredited) with wet-lab experience working at NHS John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, contributing to histopathology diagnostics and tissue processing. Currently I am studying a MsC in Bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham.

I am now combining my clinical foundation with a growing skillset in **bioinformatics, Python, data analysis, machine learning/AI, R studio and Linux command line** 

ðŸ’» I am passionate about bioinformatics, multi-omics data analysis, and using Python to uncover patterns in biological datasets. My GitHub is a growing collection of self-driven projects, scripts, and pipelines â€” from sequence alignment tools to omics integration systems.

## ðŸ“ˆ My skillset includes:

- ðŸ§¬ Biopython, Pandas, BLAST, NCBIWWW, SeqIO
- ðŸ“Š Statistical analysis: ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk, feature selection
- ðŸ§  Real-world project experience in transcriptomics, genomics & viral sequence tracking
- ðŸ§ª NHS lab experience with FFPE block preparation, reagent handling & UKAS-compliant workflows
- ðŸŒ± Currently levelling up through personal projects, MSc Bioinformatics preparation, and continued NHS experience â€” aiming to specialise in clinical bioinformatics and contribute to precision medicine.

## ðŸ“š Projects highlight:

- COVID-19 Sequence Tracker
- Gene Identification Tool
- Multi-Omics Integration Pipeline
